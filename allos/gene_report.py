"""This module focuses on the **GeneReports** class, which extends the capabilities of the AnnDataIso and TranscriptPlots classes to provide comprehensive gene-level analysis and visualization tools. It is specifically designed to handle gene expression data, offering specialized methods to efficiently manage and analyze data from various single-cell RNA sequencing protocols, facilitating seamless integration and manipulation within the Allos framework."""
